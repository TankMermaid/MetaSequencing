# MetaSequencing

This is a pipeline for metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing analysis within the CGAT pipeline framework.
It is centered around contig assembly and denovo ORF detection from contigs at the per sample level.

This is currently in development, building upon individual pipelines that were previously made on an older version of CGATPipelines.
